smtpcheckaddresses.py

Checks given email addresses on SMTP level.

The intended use is to validate a MX email server configuration when it comes
to email addresses / domains. E.g. during a migration just before going in
production one might to check that all configured email address are accepted
and not bouncing.

smtpcheckaddresses.py accpepts a list of email addresses in a text file, one
line per address. For each address it then opens a connection to a given host
and checks the return code for the "RCPT TO" command. If the return code is in
the range 200 to 299 the email address is assumed to be "OK".

Additionally when given the -s option it sends a short test email to the
addresses so you can check that mails are really delivered locally and not
relayed. It is wise to provide also some email addresses which must fail.

smtpcheckaddresses.py was hacked together in about one hour. So don't expect
much error/exception handling. Needless to say that you use it at your own
risk.
